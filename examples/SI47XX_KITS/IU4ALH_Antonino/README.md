  This sketch runs on ESP32 device on a ili9341 display.  It is an adaptation written by IU4ALH, Antonio.

  The original interface design of the sketch used here was written by Volos (https://github.com/VolosR/TEmbedFMRadio). 
  The Volos' project is a receiver based on the TEA5767 device and the PU2CLR, Ricardo, has adapted it to the SI473X device using the LilyGO T-EMBED painel.  After, IU4ALH, Antonio worked on Ricardo's sketch and adapted it to ESP32 and ili9341 display.
  This sketch implements the main functions of the SI4732/SI4735. It is  a  complete  radio  capable  to  
  tune  on  AM  and  SSB  modes from 150 to 30.000 kHz  and also FM mode from 64 to 108 MHz.
